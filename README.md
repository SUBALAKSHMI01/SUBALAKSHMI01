Hi, I’m Subalakshmi 👋  

I’m a second-year Information Technology undergraduate who believes that strong software
engineering starts with **clear fundamentals, structured thinking, and consistent practice**.

I enjoy learning concepts deeply and building small but complete projects that help me
understand how real systems work internally, rather than just using tools at a surface level.

---

## 🧠 What I Focus On
- Strengthening core Java and object-oriented programming concepts
- Improving problem-solving skills through Data Structures & Algorithms
- Building simple, meaningful projects with clean structure
- Learning by implementing systems from scratch
- Growing steadily with consistency and clarity

## 🛠️ Technical Skills

### Core Programming & DSA
- Java (OOP, Collections)
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Problem Solving (LeetCode)

### Backend (Foundations)
- Spring Boot (basic REST APIs)
- MySQL

### Frontend (Basics)
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, core concepts)

### Tools & Environment
- Git & GitHub

## 📌 Featured Project

### 🔹 Smart Version Control Simulator (Java)
A simplified version control system inspired by Git, built to understand how versioning
systems work internally.

**Key Features**
- Commit creation and version tracking
- Undo / rollback functionality using **Stack**
- O(1) version retrieval using **HashMap**
- Ordered version history using **ArrayList**
- Clean object-oriented design with edge-case handling

**What I Learned**
- How multiple data structures work together in real systems
- Trade-offs between speed, ordering, and memory
- Writing modular, readable, and maintainable Java code

**Tech Used:** Java | OOP | ArrayList | HashMap | Stack
